# quiz Frontend

0. make sure the rails server is running https://github.com/Samparkyn/quiz-rails-sv (`rails s`)
1. run `npm start`to start the server
2. navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

What I would like to improve on:
1. Add tests in order to check that the functionality of the quiz works

Enjoy! Thanks for looking :)
